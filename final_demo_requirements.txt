User Evaluation (optional, 5% bonus)
Performing a user evaluation for your dashboard. We will cover common methods of visualization evaluation in lectures. 
The evaluation must be completed before the final project demo and reported in a separate PDF document.

Final Demo. (Tentatively will start on 4/26)
Final project demos will be held online during the last two or three classes (depending on the number of teams). 
Each group will be given 15 minutes to present their work. The 15 minutes should be roughly broken down as follows:

a short slideshow, presenting data, user, and tasks (~3 mins)
live demo of the tool (~10 mins)
question and answer (~2 mins)
The presentation date and order will be assigned randomly. 
Therefore, you need to make sure that your tool is ready before the first date when presentations start.

Demos will be evaluated according to these high-level criteria:

The match between the defined user tasks and the toolâ€™s functionalities
Design of effective and efficient visualizations that match data type and support user tasks
Supporting interactivity
Supporting data manipulation and transformation
Supporting exploration
