## Previously:

 - import csv to D3 [done]
 - Get the x and y axis for dashboard [done]
 - display scatter plot of monthly demand for city hotel [done]

## Thoughts

  - Preprocess data and generate specified dataframes in python (on jupyter notebook)
    - including getting the x-axis labels ordered, showing only a type of hotel, etc
  - Import the prepared csv into d3 and just display 
    - Use `scaleBand()` for categorical data (x-axis) and `scaleLinear()` for quantitative data (y-axis)

## TODOs

  - Make histogram and line plot instead of scatter plot
  - Make csv files for monthly demand resort, all-time demand, etc.
  - interactability through clicking buttons, dropdown menu, etc.
